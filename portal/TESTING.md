# Local Testing Guide

This guide covers how to run tests locally for the Prequel Portal project.

## ðŸš€ Quick Reference

```bash
# Essential commands for daily development
npm run test:quick   # âš¡ Fast pre-commit validation (2-3 min)
npm run test:dev     # ðŸ‘€ Watch mode during development
npm run test:all     # ðŸ§ª Complete test suite for PRs (5-10 min)

# Individual test types
npm run test         # Unit tests only
npm run test:e2e     # E2E tests only
npm run test:e2e:ui  # Interactive E2E debugging

# Code quality
npm run format       # Fix formatting
npm run lint         # Check code quality
npm run build        # Verify build works
```

## Quick Start

### ðŸš€ Pre-commit Testing (Recommended)

Run this before every commit to ensure everything works:

```bash
npm run test:quick
```

### ðŸ§ª Full Test Suite

Run the complete test suite (takes longer):

```bash
npm run test:all
```

### ðŸ‘€ Development Mode

Watch for file changes and re-run tests automatically:

```bash
npm run test:dev
```

## Individual Test Commands

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests once
npm run test

# Watch mode - re-runs when files change
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests

```bash
# Run E2E tests headless (faster)
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with browser UI (slower, good for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Interactive Playwright UI (best for writing/debugging tests)
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Check code formatting
npm run format:check

# Fix code formatting
npm run format

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Build check
npm run build
```

## Test Types & Locations

### Unit Tests (`src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`)

- **Component Tests**: `src/components/__tests__/`
- **Hook Tests**: `src/hooks/__tests__/`
- **API Tests**: `src/app/api/**/__tests__/`
- **Page Tests**: `src/app/__tests__/`

### E2E Tests (`e2e/*.spec.ts`)

- **User Workflows**: `e2e/portal.spec.ts`

## Development Workflow

### 1. During Development

```bash
# Start the dev server in one terminal
npm run dev

# Run tests in watch mode in another terminal
npm run test:dev
```

### 2. Before Committing

```bash
# Quick validation (2-3 minutes)
npm run test:quick
```

### 3. Before Creating PR

```bash
# Full test suite (5-10 minutes)
npm run test:all
```

## Debugging Tests

### Unit Test Debugging

1. Use `test.only()` or `describe.only()` to run specific tests
2. Add `console.log()` statements in tests
3. Use VS Code Jest extension for debugging

### E2E Test Debugging

1. Run with `npm run test:e2e:headed` to see browser
2. Use `await page.pause()` to pause execution
3. Run `npm run test:e2e:ui` for interactive debugging

### Common Issues

#### "Module not found" errors

- Check if `moduleNameMapping` is correct in `jest.config.js`
- Ensure imports use `@/` alias correctly

#### E2E tests fail locally

- Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
- Make sure dev server is running on port 3000

#### Tests timeout

- Increase timeout in `jest.config.js` or `playwright.config.ts`
- Check for infinite loops or polling issues

## Test Coverage

Run coverage report to see which parts of the code need more tests:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Coverage reports are generated in `coverage/` directory. Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser to see detailed coverage.

## Writing New Tests

### Unit Tests

1. Create test file next to the component/function being tested
2. Use descriptive test names: `it('should display error message when API fails')`
3. Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
4. Mock external dependencies

### E2E Tests

1. Add new test cases to `e2e/portal.spec.ts`
2. Use page object pattern for complex interactions
3. Mock API responses when needed
4. Test real user workflows, not implementation details

## Performance Tips

- Use `test:quick` for regular development
- Use `test:watch` for TDD workflow
- Only run `test:all` before important commits/PRs
- Use `test.only()` to focus on specific failing tests
- Keep E2E tests fast by mocking external APIs

## CI Integration

The GitHub Actions CI only runs basic validation:

- Code formatting check
- Linting
- Build verification
- Terraform validation

Full testing is expected to be done locally before pushing.
